	<h1><a href='#division-considered-harmful' id='division-considered-harmful'>Division Considered Harmful</a></h1>
	<p>When one thinks of division, they think of long division by hand.
	When a computer scientist thinks of division, they think of fast binary division performed by a CPU.
	There is another division, division over numbers in an arbitrary precision arithmetic system.</p>
	<p>Arbitrary precision arithmetic is the next step up from fast binary arithmetic operators on machine words.
	Subroutines that perform this arithmetic combine multiple (or an <i>arbitrary</i> amount of) machine words to contain a numerical value which may be larger than what can be held in a single word.
	The manner in which a CPU performs arithmetic on arbitrary precision numbers is oddly similar to how a person does figures on paper.
	It simply iterates over all the individual words comprising the whole numerical unit.</p>
