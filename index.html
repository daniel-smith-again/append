	<h1><a href='#lisp-semantics-could-be-better' id='lisp-semantics-could-be-better'>Lisp Semantics Could Be Better</a></h1>
	<p>Lisp has been at the forefront of development for every new paradigm in programming languages. 
	If it wasn't the origin of a specific feature, then it was the environment used to test it. 
	At the same time, Lisp is the second oldest programming language. However, that statement is a slight misnomer.</p>
	<p>There has not been a single cannonical Lisp language which has persisted throughout time. 
	(One could make the case that Common Lisp<a href=""><sup>*</sup></a> is the most accurate Lisp, but concensus is not the same as canonnicity.)
	Rather, there has been a multitude of Lisps which all manifest the same overall structure, but vary wildly.<a href=""><sup>*</sup>></a>
	Observe the variances in the ways modern Lisp languages function.
	Each language has fundamental differences in their semantics which are all expressed in the same Uniform-And-Homoiconic-Syntax&trade;.</p>
	<p>Here there lives a most persnickity weakness. 
	Lisp is expected to be, and touted as, <i>the</i> groundbreaking programming tool which expands minds, puts hair on chests, and launches academic careers to the top of the Ivory Tower.
	Except that it isn't.
	If one wants to learn about Functional Programming, Haskell is a better choice.
	If one desires to architect with objects, Smalltalk is best.<br>
	For logic, Prolog.<br>
	For matricies and arrays, APL.<br>
	For dynamic typing, Smalltalk again.<br>
	For static typing, Haskell.<br>
	For imperative programming, C.<br>
	For concurrency, Go.<br>
	For garbage collection, D.<br>
	For recursion, Scheme (finally, a Lisp!).<br>
	For extensibility, Forth (oh dear reader, you thought I'd mention macros didn't you...)</p>
	<p>Lisp has lost it's mind-expanding-drug status. 
	Other languages have matured and are far more suitable for different things.
	That's all well and good, for that's the nature of human expression.
	I can hear the protests already that Lisps macro system enables all of everything to be expressed through DSL's and other wonderful abstractions.
	This is simply no longer true.
	The CLOS does not have the same power as basic Smalltalk without losing what little berevity it has.
	Most lisp implementations provide concurrency as an afterthought with very little of the expressive power of Lisp spent on the semantics.
	Lisps are all still dynamically typed in the worst sense of the term, even though there's no reason at all preventing eval from verifying a form it's passed.</p>
	<p>So by now, dear reader, you must have written me off as a lousy crank, just like everyone else today who doesn't pay proper respects to the One True Language&trade;.
	On the contrary, I have been sent here as a prophet, to write this article shining light on the golden path which future Lisp implementations can follow.
	And I mean that with every bit of conceit intended seeing how Lisp users have highroaded everyone for the last 50 years. (Really, the sheer nerve, and with stop the world GC!.)
	Those of you struggling in the dark, fear not, for who really can know better until they've experienced it<a href=""><sup>*</sup></a>.</p>
	<h2>The Solution</h2>
	<p>Allow me to elucidate.
	The Lisp language, all things considered, actually refers to a very narrow corner of what a programmming language is. 
	Dear reader, for the rest of this article I ask that you consider Lisp for what it is, a symbolic rewrite system.
	It's true that all existing Lisps fit that description. 
	I mean that LISP Lisp is <b>only</b> a symbolic rewrite system.
	The only operations in this language are the ones that manipulate symtax.
	No functions, no vectors, strings, arrays, objects, lammbdas, etc...
	Just LISP 0.1.
	What does eval do? 
	Expand macros and give you a normal form.</p>
	<p>Lisp just being Lisp is a tarpit though (a tarpit with TCO that is).
	Now I have The Diverging, Untyped, Lambda Calculus via the macro system.
	This is no good, so we add a static type system to the form.
	The only thing we have to type is forms, but this leads to an interesting property.
	The reduction of a form is not decided by the first symbol, but by the type of the form.
	Rather than prefix notation, you have whatever-you-like-fixity as long as you put it in a closed pair of braces.
	I can hear you say, dear reader, "but Prophet of the Golden Lisp, isn't that string types?!"
	Yes, its string-typing with sequences of symbols, what of it?
	Now that we have statically verified types, we have a reasonable amount of decidability such that we can avoid divergence where it isn't wanted.</p>
	<p>The next interesting property is that lisp forms are still organized into a tree structure.
	This is very convenient because two forms that are at the same level can be evaluated at the same time without adverse effects.
	It helps that the Lisp that we're dealing with now is purely functional as macro expansion is referentially transparent.
	Closures let us program using whatever concurrent process communication paradigm we want.</p>
	<p>Next up is logic. 
	Boolean values are missing from this language.
	However, functional logic programming normally uses success and failure rather than boolean values. 
	Adding a null value should do the trick.
	Now we have enough to create conditional evaluation as a macro which expands to the second or third form depending on whether the first form expands to something, or null.
	Another facet of logic programming is the ability to perform unification on variables according some statement.
	This is already possible with the macro systems' ability to inspect forms, create forms, and consequently unify two forms. (naturally all according to some unification algorithm <a href=""><sup>*</sup></a>)</p>
	<p>Now we have, concurrent functional logic objects... programming.
	That sounds more like the pinnacle of all language development.
	And without a single DSL, extension, built-in macro, or primitive function.
	</p>
	<p>Of course now we can get much fancier with things like data structures.
	A quoted list of symbols sure seems like a record with a little squinting. 
	We had structural typing two paragraphs ago since all forms are "stringly" typed.
	Now we have structurally typed records using quoted forms.
	Forms are still our only actual datatype anyway so this works.
	However, we need some primitives for working with forms-as-structures.
	Set algebra is a good start. 
	You can add, subtract, multiply (power set), and divide (relative complement) quoted forms.
	What if one wishes to decompose a form?
	Elements of a quoted form (which are more forms of course) can be selected by either indexed position or type (set division using an element).</p>
	<p>I mentioned the ability to index forms back there.
	That sounds like numbers.
	It is numbers because this Lisp should naturally have numbers.
	Whole numbers of course.
	For the academics, a number is the cardinality of a quoted form.
	For the pragmatists, you can just read an all-digits symbol as a number.</p>
	<p>Let's take stock of what monster this rant has described so far.
	We have a Lisp in all its homoiconic, uniform glory.
	It has whole numbers, indexed multisets, general recursion, static typing (of some sort), concurrency, logic, and object orientation (as a poor man's closure<a href=""><sup>*</sup></a>).
	That's quite a lot.
	It either has every cool new idea, or you can make the cool new idea as a macro.
	This is the kind of Lisp that would <i>really</i> do some mind expanding.
	There's enough here to make coroutines, differential equation solvers, algebraic effect handlers, dynamic bindings, CLOS, meta-objects, etc...
	Remember, dear reader, how short this article is.
	Burn it into your minds what could be and how simple it really is.</p>
	<p>I suppose now I should address the static typing that I never addressed. 
	Those of you who are academically inclined have probably stopped reading by now.
	Types are actually quite simple to implement in this language as they are list types.
	All you need is a "recognizer" macro which looks at a form and returns its identity if the form is according to a certain notion of a type, or else returns null.
	The type assertion will then expand to the object of the assertion being handed to the macro which guarantees this assertion.
	Depending on the timing of where this recognizer macro is expanded, one has full-unrestricted dependent typing in all its terrifying expressiveness.</p>
	<p>Remember, dear reader, what Lisp could be.</p>
