<h3>My thoughts on the PL runtime design space.</h3>
<p>It's a common refrain in the world of software to sing the virtues of "live" programming environments.
Stuff like <a target="_blank" href="https://julialang.org">Julia</a>, 
<a target="_blank" href="https://jupyter.org">Jupyter</a>, 
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica">Mathematica</a>, 
<a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smalltalk">Smalltalk</a>,
<a target="_blank" href="https://gtoolkit.com/">Actual Smalltalk</a>,
and <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Lisp">Lisp</a>.
They are useful tools, and they carry useful ideas.</p>
<p>A "live" environment usually means that the programming language is primarily engaged by typing the program text into a shell session.
It also means that some form of management process exists to take the program text in and turn it into something executable in the environment.
Here's the rub, once you're done programming, there's no way to get your program back out from the live environment.</p>
